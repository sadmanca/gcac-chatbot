There will be no live lectures. Instead, students watch pre-recorded videos at their convenience. Those who want to practise giving a presentation after learning helpful techniques form the videos may sign up to give a trial presentation in bi-weekly presentation sessions. These sessions include a teacher and 3-4 other graduate students. Each student comes prepared to give a 7-8 minute presentation and to receive feedback from the teacher and other students. if you decide to sign up for a presentation session then you must participate in the full 60-minute presentation session in order to give feedback to the other presenters who have given feedback to you. You are welcome to use these sessions as an opportunity to rehearse part/all of a presentation you are preparing for a course, thesis committee meeting, or conference.
