WHY, WHAT, AND HOW?
WHY A CIHR WRITING INTENSIVE COURSE?
Many departments in the Social Sciences, Physical and Life Sciences
require eligible incoming graduate students to apply for ″CIHR
awards.″  The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which
is funded by the Canadian government, offers Master’s and doctoral
awards for graduate students conducting health research. Only Canadian
citizens and permanent residents of Canada are eligible to apply.
Deadlines for the doctoral applications are set by graduate
departments, and they are usually in late September or early October.
 
For many years, the Graduate Centre for Academic Communication
(GCAC) has offered courses on Writing CIHR Proposals to graduate
students who are preparing to apply for CIHR Master’s or doctoral
awards. Good CIHR proposals are hard to write, and they are also hard
to prepare during the busy beginning of term. The goal of this
writing-intensive version of our CIHR course is to encourage students
to devote concentrated time to writing their CIHR proposals before the
business of term begins.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GCAC’S REGULAR CIHR ​COURSE AND THE
WRITING INTENSIVE VERSION OF THE COURSE?
The writing-intensive version of the CIHR course takes place over FOUR
DAYS ON AUGUST 8-11 (INCLUSIVE) FROM 9:00 A.M. − 10:15 A.M. The
course also provides both online and in-person tutorials and
one-on-one appointments to students who have drafts to submit for
feedback (dates to be scheduled).
​LOGISTICS
The August CIHR Intensive course will be offered in a live online
format. Given the proprietary nature of research grants, and the fact
that this course shows samples of winning grants (with authors’
permission), this course will only be offered live and will not be
recorded. Students who wish to take the course must attend at the
times of the live online classes listed above.
ELIGIBILITY & REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
Enrollment is open to registered graduate students at the University
of Toronto who are applying for Master’s or doctoral CIHR grants or
for OGS (Ontario Graduate Scholarships) in the fall of 2023. Those
applying for postdoctoral fellowships are not eligible to
participate. 
PLEASE NOTE: This is a fully synchronous course that will not be
recorded. Attendance at all 5 hours of the online course is mandatory
for registration.Students who register and do not attend the full
course will be ineligible to register in other courses with the
Graduate Centre for Academic Communication (GCAC) during the fall
term. To register, click the button below:
