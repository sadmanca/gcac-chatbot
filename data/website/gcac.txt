WELCOME TO THE GRADUATE CENTRE FOR ACADEMIC COMMUNICATION (GCAC).
GCAC PROVIDES GRADUATE STUDENTS WITH ADVANCED TRAINING IN ACADEMIC
WRITING AND SPEAKING. 
WE ARE NOW LOCATED ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE MCMURRICH BUILDING (12
QUEEN’S PARK CRESCENT WEST)​. FOR GENERAL INQUIRIES, PLEASE
CONTACT US AT SGS.GCAC@UTORONTO.CA.
Graduate students need to be able to communicate sophisticated
information to sophisticated audiences. As you prepare to attend your
first conference, to write your first proposal, or to publish your
first paper, you will need stronger communication skills than those
needed in undergraduate work. By emphasizing professional development
rather than remediation, GCAC can help you cultivate the ability to
diagnose and address the weaknesses in your oral and written work.
GCAC offers five types of support designed to target the needs of
both native and non-native speakers of English: non-credit courses,
single-session workshops, individual writing consultations, writing
intensives, and a list of additional resources for academic writing
and speaking.
All of our programs are free. COURSES, WORKSHOPS and WRITING
INTENSIVES require registration. WRITING
CENTRE CONSULTATIONS require an appointment. 
NOTES
      INTERNATIONAL VISITING GRADUATE STUDENTS (IVGS)​

however, THEY ARE INELIGIBLE FOR GCAC COURSES AND WRITING CENTRE
APPOINTMENTS.
      If you need to know the location of a course in which you are

T profile.
