      Boot Camps and Writing Intensives
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​GCAC Boot Camps
and Intensive Courses are designed to give U of T graduate students a
blend of expert guidance and dedicated writing time. We offer support
in dissertation writing, proposal writing, and research article
writing, at different points throughout the year. For more
info​​​rmation on each, please see below. By combining
opportunities for distraction-free writing with instruction on complex
graduate writing genres, we help graduate students to meet their
writing goals, deepen their understanding of academic writing, and
build a community of writers.
