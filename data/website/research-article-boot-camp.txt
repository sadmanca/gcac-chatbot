      Research Article Boot Camp: Fall 2023
WHY, WHAT, WHO, AND HOW?
WHY A VIRTUAL RESEARCH ARTICLE BOOT CAMP?
Getting your research published is a priority for graduate students,
but finding uninterrupted time for writing is often challenging. If
you have completed your research but are struggling to find the time
to get it down on paper, this boot camp can help. The Virtual Research
Article Boot Camp is a chance to step away from the obligations and
distractions of everyday living and focus exclusively on writing for
two days, in an online setting.
WHAT IS A VIRTUAL RESEARCH ARTICLE BOOT CAMP?
The GCAC Virtual Research Article Boot Camp is designed to provide U
of T graduate students with uninterrupted time and distraction-free
space to focus solely on your writing. With teacher-led training
sessions, you will enjoy the much-needed support and advice to help
start, make progress, or complete your research article for
submission.
To truly focus on writing, you will be staying away from emails,
social media, and the like for the two days (lunch breaks excepted),
giving you the opportunity to get some writing done, learn about the
writing process, and discuss the process of writing with a writing
instructor and your peer graduate students. A crucial goal of the camp
is to help you discover the joy of writing, learn to deal with
writing-related challenges, and establish a productive writing
practice.
WHO SHOULD SIGN UP?
In order to sign up for the GCAC Research Article Boot Camp, the
following conditions apply:
      ​Your research and data collection must be finished, i.e., you
need to be at a point where the only logical thing to do is write.
Boot Camp is for writing, not further reading and research.
      You are willing to set goals and strive to reach them, to commit to
a two-day program and to realize your potential for self-disciplined
writing.
