WORKSHOPS
      Resources & Supports
      Graduate Centre for Academic Communication
      Workshops
While GCAC’s workshops are designed with graduate students in mind,
all members of the University of Toronto community are welcome to
attend as many workshops as they wish. We offer two types of
workshops: live online (synchronous) workshops and pre-recorded,
on-demand (asynchronous) workshops. Registration for both types of
workshops is required.
Please click the title of each workshop to read the workshop
description and registration details. Once you register, you will
receive details on how to join each synchronous or asynchronous
workshop you have chosen. If you are are not able to register online,
please contact sgs.gcac@utoronto.ca to be registered manually.
GCAC’s weekly Listserv messages provide an easy way to keep track
of what upcoming synchronous workshops we are offering each week.
