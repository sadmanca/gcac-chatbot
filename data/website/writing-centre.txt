WRITING CENTRE
      Resources & Supports
      Graduate Centre for Academic Communication
      Writing Centre
THE GCAC WRITING CENTRE OFFERS TWO TYPES OF APPOINTMENTS. THE MAJORITY
ARE ONLINE (SYNCHRONOUS) WITH SOME IN-PERSON APPOINTMENTS:
During a SYNCHRONOUS APPOINTMENT, you will meet with the writing
consultant online at the booked time. The consultant will work with
you using audio/video, chat and a document-sharing whiteboard area. 
During an IN-PERSON APPOINTMENT, you must arrive 5-10 minutes before
the scheduled appointment time at the GCAC Writing Centre (MR108, 1st
floor, McMurrich Building, 12 Queen’s Park Crescent West) and bring
a hard copy of your writing sample. The Writing Instructor will
provide you with feedback during the appointment. If you arrive early
for your appointment, you may wait in the Writing Centre’s waiting
area (outside MR108) until your appointment time.
            -
One-on-on​e consultations ​are available for graduate students who
seek individualized assistance with their writing. In these sessions,
trained instructors work with you to improve your capacity to plan,
write, and revise your academic assignments. Instructors do not edit
for you; they teach you to revise and edit your own work.
PLEASE NOTE: The following departments/faculties offer their own
writing support through one-on-one consultations: Architecture, OISE,
Nursing, Pharmacy, Physical Education, Public Health (PhD students)
and Social Work. Students from these departments/faculties are also
eligible to book appointments at the GCAC Writing Centre. While their
home writing centre will be better able to support them with course
assignments and with discipline-specific writing, they may _also_ wish
to visit the GCAC Writing Centre for additional support for general
academic writing (e.g., grant proposals, research articles, or
theses).
HOW TO BOOK A GCAC WRITING CENTRE APPOINTMENT
STEP 1: LOG IN
Log in to the WCONLINE booking system at
HTTPS://UOFT.ME/WRITINGCENTRES and select the “GCAC Writing
Centre”. When you log in, you will b​​e prompted to enter your
UTORid and password. (If you have questions about UTORid, please visit
UTORid Management.)

STEP 2: VIEW THE SCHEDULE
On the top of the booking site, you can scroll through weeks and you
can sort by type of appointment. Appointments are usually released for
booking two or three weeks in advance of the appointment dates so you
will only see the available appointments for the next two or three
weeks.
Scroll down past the announcements and on the left you will see the
week’s dates. Below the date you will see the consultant(s) name(s).
And beside the consultant’s name you will see the type of
appointment: either “Synchronous Online Appointment” or
“In-person or Synchronous Online Appointment”. All appointments in
the row will correspond with the type of appointment.

consultant and appointment type you wish to book and fill out the

waiting list will receive a notification, and the appointment is

HOW TO JOIN YOUR SYNCHRONOUS ONLINE APPOINTMENT 
If you have booked a SYNCHRONOUS ONLINE APPOINTMENT you will meet
with the writing consultant online at the booked time. The consultant
will work with you using audio/video, chat and a document-sharing
whiteboard area.
To participate in your online appointment, log back in to
HTTPS://UOFT.ME/WRITINGCENTRES approximately five minutes before the
start of your appointment. You will need a webcam and microphone and
ensure that your local internet provider has not put up any firewalls
for this form of communication. Try to use
Firefox or Chrome browsers and make sure you have their latest
version installed. 
CLICK ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND CLICK “START OR JOIN ONLINE
CONSULTATION.” If you are unable to join using the default video
conferencing platform, please contact John
at SGS.GCAC@UTORONTO.CA and he will set up your appointment through
an alternate platform.
IN-PERSON APPOINTMENTS
If you have booked an in-person appointment, you must bring a hard
copy of your writing sample to your appointment with the Writing
Instructor. The Writing Instructor will provide you with a feedback
during the appointment time.
Please ensure to arrive 5-10 minutes before the scheduled appointment
time to the GCAC Writing Centre (Room MR108, 1st Floor, 12 Queen’s
Park Crescent West) and wait in the Writing Centre’s waiting area
(outside room MR108) until the appointment start time.
GCAC WRITING CENTRE POLICIES
There are a limited number of one-on-one consultations available, and
the demand for appointments is high. In order to make the best use of
this limited resource, we have strict attendance and cancellation
policies.
      You may carry TWO appointments at any given time, but YOU MAY NOT
BOOK TWO WITHIN THE SAME CALENDAR WEEK. 
      You are limited to FOUR appointments the Summer 2023 term (May 1
– September 1)
      If you can no longer attend the appointment you must cancel AT
LEAST 48 HOURS in advance of the appointment. Failure to cancel 48
hours in advance will result in a 1 point penalty applied to your
record at the Writing Centre.
      ​If you do not cancel a synchronous appointment and do not attend
the appointment online or by phone, you will incur a 1 point
penalty. 
      If you are more than ten minutes late, your appointment will be
treated as missed and you will incur a 1 point penalty.
      PENALTIES WILL BE CLEARED AT THE END OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR I.E. MAY
3, 2024 BY 5PM.
ONCE YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED 2 PENALTY POINTS, YOU WILL BE LOCKED OUT
FROM THE WRITING CENTRE BOOKING SYSTEM, AND YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA
EMAIL. ALSO, ANY FUTURE APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY BOOKED WILL
BE CANCELLED.​
The GCAC Writing Centre is not a proofreading service. Our mandate is
to teach students to improve their own writing and speaking. In our
courses, workshops, and consulting appointments, students are taught
to identify and address the problems in their writing. While we
recognize that this process takes much longer than a quick copy edit,
we also know that students are not well served by becoming dependent
on our writing skills instead of developing their own.
