​INFORMAL ACADEMIC COMMUNICATION (FOR NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS OF
ENGLISH)
MONDAYS, 4:00 P.M. – 5:30 P.M., MCLENNAN PHYSICAL LABORATORIES, 255
HURON STREET, ROOM 134​
ACCESSIBILITY: Main entrance: powered entrance at grade.The entrance
is only visible from the street looking through the parkette from St.
George Street​.​​​
All workshops in this series are taught by Clare Nippard.
MAY 6: EMAIL ETIQUETTE​ 
A great number of important academic interactions take place over
email. Are you sometimes unsure how to express yourself in these
conversations? Using a case-study approach, this workshop will address
when to use email, what to include in an email, how to open and close
an email, and how to achieve the right level of formality.​​
​MAY 13: USING SMALL TALK FOR NETWORKING​ 
Meeting new colleagues, interacting with peers, attending conferences,
interviewing for a job; in all of these contexts, small talk helps us
establish professional connections. However, using small talk
effectively is challenging: sometimes we are not sure how to initiate
a conversation, what to talk about, or how much to say. This workshop
will focus on practical strategies to build confidence and skill in
small talk for networking.​​​
​​WRITING IN GRADUATE SCHOOL
TUESDAYS, 4:00 P.M. – 5:30 P.M., BAHEN CENTRE INFORMATION TECH, 40
ST. GEORGE STREET, ROOM 1200
ACCESSIBILITY: Main entrance: powered door approached by ramp and
stair. The entrance faces west and is clearly visible from St. George
Street.​​​
All workshops in this series are taught by Dr. Trevor Cook.
MAY 7: WRITING CORRECTLY (WITHOUT GRAMMARLY OR MICROSOFT WORD)​ 
Canadian students used to learn the rules of English by rote. That is
seldom the case anymore. Beginning in the 1980s, grade-school teachers
began privileging comprehension over correctness, meaning that you
might have made it all the way to graduate school without a firm grasp
of the basics of English grammar. You are not alone! This workshop
will provide a refresher for both native and fluent non-native
speakers of English, with special emphasis on how practically to
detect and correct the most common errors in graduate student writing,
without an editor, word processor, or third-party program.​​
​MAY 14: IMPROVING FLOW IN ACADEMIC WRITING: COHESION AND
COHERENCE​ 
Flow is an essential quality of good academic writing; it’s
important that our ideas move seamlessly from one to another. But flow
isn’t a particularly helpful metaphor, especially when we are told
that it is missing from our writing. How does one improve something as
slippery as ‘flow’? This workshop will discuss two specific types
of flow: cohesion, the movement between sentences; and coherence, the
connections between sections of a document. Participants will be
introduced to concrete steps they can take to objectively evaluate and
correct both in their own writing.​​​
