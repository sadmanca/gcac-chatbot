      Virtual Dissertation Boot Camp: August 2023
WHY, WHAT, WHO, AND HOW?
WHY A VIRTUAL DISSERTATION BOOT CAMP?
​​​Writing a dissertation is a priority for doctoral students,
but finding productive writing time is often a challenge. Despite its
centrality, the dissertation is frequently neglected amidst all the
obligations and distractions of everyday life. The Virtual
Dissertation Boot Camp is a chance to step away from that routine and
focus exclusively on dissertation writing for three days, in an online
setting.
WHAT IS A VIRTUAL DISSERTATION BOOT CAMP?
​The Virtual Dissertation Boot ​Camp will give you dedicated
blocks of writing time as well as the opportunity to learn about
strategies for productive dissertation writing. You’ll be required
to set aside other demands on your time for three days, giving you the
opportunity to make significant progress in your writing. We will also
discuss various productivity approaches to help you gain momentum in
your writing that will last beyond our three days together.
WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO ENROL IN THE VIRTUAL DISSERTATION BOOT CAMP?
In order to sign up for the GCAC Virtual Dissertation Boot Camp, you
MUST meet the following conditions:
      You are actively engaged in writing a doctoral dissertation in any
department at U of T; the dissertation boot camp is not open to
Master’s students.
      You are finished with course work, qualifying exams, and primary
research and/or data collection; the boot camp is designed for
writing, not further reading and research.
