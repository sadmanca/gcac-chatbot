​​​ACS – ACADEMIC CONVERSATION SKILLS (FOR NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS
OF ENGLISH)
This course is for non-native speakers of English who wish to improve
their listening and speaking skills in order to communicate more
effectively in an academic environment. If you have difficulty
participating in class discussion or speaking to your classmates and
professors, either online or in person, this course is designed to
meet your needs. Over six weeks, participants will gain confidence as
they develop their ability to engage in academic discussion. Through
active student participation and reflection, ACS focuses on topics
such as how to ask and answer challenging questions, how to disagree
respectfully, and how to manage academic interactions sensitively.
Course duration: 6 weeks.

​​​AG – ADVANCED GRAMMAR FOR MULTILINGUAL GRADUATE WRITERS
_ADVANCED GRAMMAR FOR MULTILINGUAL GRADUATE WRITERS (AG) _is designed
to support non-native speakers of English in improving the grammatical
correctness of their academic writing. Students will learn to
self-diagnose their most common grammatical errors, to apply the key
grammatical rules learned throughout the course, to develop strategies
to enhance grammatical correctness, and to identify resources for
improving their grammar. Key topics include maintaining subject-verb
agreement; avoiding punctuation problems; using relative clauses
correctly; minimizing article errors; and understanding common
sentence structure errors. The course will consist of five lectures
of 2 hours each; students will also have an opportunity to submit a
writing sample for individual feedback. _Multilingual writers should
also plan to take GW1 and GW2_. We recommend taking GW1 first, before
either AG or GW2. If you have already taken the ACADEMIC WRITING
sequence, please note that AG is the _same_ course as AW2; we don’t
recommend taking this course if you’ve already completed AW2.
Course duration: 5 weeks.

​​CIHR – WRITING CIHR PROPOSALS  
During three, two-hour online classes, participants will learn
strategies to improve the persuasiveness, clarity, and impact of their
research proposal. While we use the CIHR proposal as an exemplar, the
strategies taught during the course will be applicable to many other
research proposals, including those for the Vanier and OGS. Students
are expected to work on their proposal during the course, and will be
eligible to have their draft proposal reviewed by the course
instructor or a GCAC consultant. Note that this course focuses on
writing strategies, not the application process for CIHR Trainee
awards.
Course duration: 3 weeks.​

​​GW1 – GRADUATE WRITING 1: ESTABLISHING YOUR FOUNDATION
_GRADUATE WRITING 1: ESTABLISHING YOUR FOUNDATION (GW1)_ is designed
to introduce graduate students to academic writing at the graduate
level. This course will focus on the transition to graduate writing by
considering the unique identity of a graduate writer. Key topics
include learning the disciplinary practices of writing through
reading; developing an authorial presence by using metadiscourse;
working with sources; and building effective structure through
paragraphing. The course will consist of five lectures of 2 hours
each; students will also have an opportunity to submit a writing
sample for individual feedback. This course is the first in our
GRADUATE WRITING sequence; the second course (GRADUATE WRITING 2:
DEEPENING YOUR EXPERTISE) builds on GW1 by teaching graduate writers
how to improve their academic writing through revision. _We recommend
that students take GW1 before taking GW2._ If you have already taken
the ACADEMIC WRITING sequence, please note that GW1 is similar to AW1
and GW2 is similar to AW3. You are entirely welcome to register for
the GW courses, but there will be significant overlap.
Course duration: 5 weeks.​

​​GW2 – GRADUATE WRITING 2: DEEPENING YOUR EXPERTISE
_GRADUATE WRITING 2: DEEPENING YOUR EXPERTISE (GW2)_ is designed to
help graduate writers develop their ability to improve their own
academic writing through revision. Most academic writers struggle to
produce reader-worthy first drafts; this course is designed to
introduce graduate students to a range of strategies for improving
their own texts. Key topics include improving coherence in academic
texts; learning how to establish flow; grasping what readers need from
sentences; revising for concision; and reviewing common issues with
writing mechanics. These topics will allow students to develop a
revision process that moves from first draft through submission. The
course will consist of five lectures of 2 hours each; students will
also have an opportunity to submit a writing sample for individual
feedback. This course is the second in our GRADUATE WRITING sequence;
the first course (GRADUATE WRITING 1: ESTABLISHING YOUR FOUNDATION) is
an introduction to academic writing at the graduate level. _We
recommend that students take GW1 before taking GW2._ If you have
already taken the ACADEMIC WRITING sequence, please note that GW1 is
similar to AW1 and GW2 is similar to AW3. If you have already taken
BECOMING A BETTER EDITOR OF YOUR OWN WORK, please note that GW2 is
similar to that course. You are entirely welcome to register for GW2,
but there will be significant overlap.
Course duration: 5 weeks.​

ISJ – INTRODUCTION TO SCIENCE JOURNALISM
This course is designed for graduate students with an interest in the
communication of science in the news media. Science journalists play a
key role in the public understanding of science by reporting on the
results and implications of scientific research. The guiding
principles and basic techniques of science journalism will be explored
through examples from print and broadcast media and through exercises
in class. The focus will be on how science becomes news, where science
journalists find their stories, how they conduct interviews and
assemble information and then translate the complexities and
motivations of research into plain language for a mass audience. The
course will also consider the evolving relationship between science
and media in the online environment and provide students with an
overview of the professional landscape.
Course duration: 3 weeks.​

NPP – NAVIGATING THE PUBLISHING PROCESS
Graduate students are often encouraged to publish, but for many
first-time authors, navigating the publishing process can be
intimidating. The goal of this course is to demystify the publishing
process by examining the various steps involved. We will begin by
considering the genre of the book review―a common first publication
for sole-author graduate students. In subsequent weeks, we will
discuss strategies for selecting journals to which to submit; revising
articles for different audiences/lengths/journal mandates;
communicating with journal editors through cover or query letters; and
responding to reviews or rejection. IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS
OF WRITING TO PUBLISH OR LOOKING TO START SOON, THIS COURSE IS
DESIGNED FOR YOU.
Course duration: 5 weeks

OPS MODULAR – MODULAR ORAL PRESENTATION SKILLS COURSE
This asynchronous version of GCAC’s Oral Presentation Skills (OPS)
course is comprised of a series of pre-recorded videos and handouts on
a range of specific topics related to giving effective presentations
(such as effective slide design, structuring presentations well,
managing nerves when presenting, effectively managing a Q and A
session, presenting online, etc.). Unlike OPS NS and OPS NNS, which
provide a live online community in which to practice presenting
together, this modular version of the course allows you to pick and
choose both how much time you want to spend and which specific oral
presentation skills you would like to work on at what time. There will
be no live lectures. Instead, students watch pre-recorded videos at
their convenience. Those who want to practise giving a presentation
after learning helpful techniques form the videos may sign up to give
a trial presentation in bi-weekly presentation sessions. These
sessions include a teacher and 3-4 other graduate students. Each
student comes prepared to give a 7-8 minute presentation and to
receive feedback from the teacher and other students. if you decide to
sign up for a presentation session then you must participate in the
full 60-minute presentation session in order to give feedback to the
other presenters who have given feedback to you. You are welcome to
use these sessions as an opportunity to rehearse part/all of a
presentation you are preparing for a course, thesis committee meeting,
or conference. This version of the course is for both native- and
non-native speakers of English. 
Course duration: Videos and handouts will be available through the
course page all term. Presentation sessions will be available every
other week.

RA 3/4 – UNDERSTANDING THE RESEARCH ARTICLE: READING TOWARDS WRITING
FOR STUDENTS ENGAGED IN EXPERIMENTAL AND POPULATION-BASED RESEARCH​.
What are the typical “moves” made in research article’s
Introduction? Should you integrate your discussion with your results?
How do you get readers to see the importance of your work? How much
explaining do you need in a methodology section? Should I use the
personal voice? What about the passive voice? These are typical
questions asked by graduate students writing research articles that
follow the “Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion” (IMRD)
format. This synchronous online course is designed to help graduate
students engaged in experimental work to not only answer those
questions, but also to improve their research article writing by
increasing their familiarity with the established forms of such
articles. To do so, we will analyze the discourse strategies of
articles that follow the IMRD pattern and consider research that has
been conducted into writing in this genre. The course will involve
lecture, class discussion and close readings of articles drawn from
representative fields of study. Students will be expected to submit
weekly assignments to the Quercus discussion board that should require
only about twenty minutes of out-of-class work each week.
RA 3/4 consists of five 90-minute synchronous (live) interactive
online classes. Please enroll only if you expect to attend all five
sessions.  Students will also be urged to book one-on-one online
conferences to discuss their own academic writing samples with the
course instructor.
Course duration: 5 weeks
