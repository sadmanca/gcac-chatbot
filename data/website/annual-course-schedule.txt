ANNUAL COURSE SCHEDULE
      Resources & Supports
      Graduate Centre for Academic Communication
      Annual Course Schedule
The Graduate Centre for Academic Communication (GCAC) ​offers a wide
range of free non-credit courses throughout the academic year. Most of
our courses have ten to twelve hours of class contact time (two hours
a week for five to six weeks), plus office hours and/or tutorials.
GCAC offers five course sessions during the academic year, and each
has its own registration date. In addition to classroom instruction,
students receive individualized feedback on their written or oral
work.​
Some of our courses are discipline-specific, while others target the
different needs of native and non-native speakers of English. Our
short courses build upon one another; this modular design enables
students to create a program of study that will address their
individual needs.
All students enrolled in a graduate degree program at U of T are
eligible to register. Since demand exceeds supply, we request that
students take any given course only once a year, with the exception of
the proposal writing courses which may be taken in both the Spring and
the Fall.​​​

LISTSERV.
