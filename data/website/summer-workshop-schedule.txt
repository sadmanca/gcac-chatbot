In this workshop, we’ll consider best practices for delivering an

Are you interested in communicating your research to non-specialist
and non-academic audiences? In this workshop, we’ll cover strategies
for effectively sharing your research outside your field. We’ll

drama, and suspense–can help you create a compelling design for your
research story​.​​​
